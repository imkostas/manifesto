# manifesto

The etymology of the word ‘manifesto’ comes from the Latin word ‘manifestus’ meaning ‘plain’, ‘obvious’, ‘evident’. Therefore, a manifesto by definition introduces statements or, better, slogans rather than arguments (we can argue between us of course!!!). We intend to make use of a structure similar to a Tractatus, in which the content actually is paradoxically contradictory with its format and axiomatic structure. Think about propositions such as sloganized expressions with a strong logical and speculative content. Our work is an open-ended job to the extent that (a) it is open to any contribution from inside and outside D&I; (b) it includes not only statements but questions as well. Some of the statements have obvious assonances between them, others not. Sometimes you may recognize the answer to a question in the statements following the question. We would like that all of you start to support cooperatively this project. The output should be proudly the output of School of Design & Innovation @Tongji University. But a git-festo about what? Questions sometimes can be more illustrative than statements.
